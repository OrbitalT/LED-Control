# LED-Control

Control an LED Strip with a raspberry pi using IFTTT, Google assistant and a custom web UI.

## Before Notice

This build tutorial is for advanced users, things to know before starting are flashing a raspberry pi with a headless OS (Raspbian Buster Lite) usage of Linux and soldering.

## Things you need

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W (or any other pi but I will be using the zero in this example)
https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400

2. IRLZ34N MOSFET (I got a pack of 20 from amazon)

3. 12V DC power supply (for short LED strips a 3A supply will do but usage will vary for longer)

4. Power Jack (Must fit power supply)

5. A high gauge of wire (different colored wires make this easier)

6. LED Strip (This project uses standard 5050 SMD RGB LEDs this strip DOES NOT allow for individual addressable LEDs)
